The Conference had an international outlook. In fact, six other students and I were selected from universities all over the world. During the conference I had the opportunity to share the results and experiences of my research, which investigates how the use of two different dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA and GPLVM), applied to a simulated dataset and a real dataset of handwritten digits, impacts on the quality of the latent spaces obtained. Attending the international conference provided new inspiration for the continuation of my journey.
